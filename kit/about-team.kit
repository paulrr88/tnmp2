        <h2 class="title less-space-bottom width-small pretty-purple">Fundraising Team</h2>

        <br />

        <p class="background-green-light">The Montessori way of teaching is a unique method that requires very specific and expensive equipment. The Pre-school is a charitable, not-for-profit making organisation and raises funds through events arranged by the Fundraising Team. This enables our pre-school to purchase additional Montessori equipment, which helps to keep the school fees at an affordable rate.</p>

        <p>The Fundraising Team meets every 6-8 weeks, dependent on the events that need to be discussed and arranged. There is always a member of staff at the meetings, so you also get to meet your child's teachers informally. <strong>New parents are always needed as we are constantly brainstorming for new fundraising ideas!</strong></p>

        <div class="centre-600">

          <?php perch_content('Image 3'); ?>

        </div>

        <p><strong>Details of the next meeting arranged for the Fundraising Team will be displayed on our notice board</strong>, as well as being highlighted in our newsletters.</p>

        <p>The Fundraising Team organises (depending on parents on the team):</p>

        <ul class="compact background-orange-light">
            <li><strong>Summer Fayre</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Winter Fayre/An Annual Raffle</strong>: Held at our Pre-schools Annual General Meeting in December</li>
            <li><strong>Christmas gifts</strong> such as: cards made by your child, calendars of your child, letters to Santa, Handprint Bags</li>
        </ul>



        <p>All these activities enable the Fundraising Team to provide extra curriculum events for the children at the end of each term, as well as contributing towards the costs of the Montessori Materials.</p>
