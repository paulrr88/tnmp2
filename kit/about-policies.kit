        <h2 class="title less-space-bottom width-small pretty-blue">Settling In</h2>

        <br />

        <p class="background-orange-light"><strong>We want our children to feel safe and happy</strong> in the absence of their parents, to recognise other adults as a source of authority, help and friendship and to be able to share with their parents afterwards the new learning experiences enjoyed in the pre-school.</p>

        <div class="centre-400">

          <?php perch_content('Image 1'); ?>

        </div>

        <p>In order to accomplish this, we will:</p>

        <ul class="body background-blue">
          <li><strong>Arrange for the child to have <em>four</em> visits to the pre-school</strong>. These visits will take place the term before the child is due to start. The four visits will comprise of two one hour visits with an adult, two one hour visits unaccompanied.</li>
          <li><strong>Make clear to families from the outset that they will be supported in the pre-school</strong> for as long as it takes to settle their child there.</li>
          <li><strong>Reassure parents</strong> whose children seem to be taking a long time settling into the Pre-school.</li>
          <li><strong>Introduce new families into the group on a staggered basis</strong>, for example two new children each day for a week rather than ten new children all at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Children cannot play or learn successfully if they are anxious and unhappy. <strong>Our settling procedures aim to help parents to help their children to feel comfortable in the pre-school</strong>, to benefit from what it has to offer, and to be confident that their parents will return at the end of the session.</p>

        <a name="equal"></a>

        <h2 class="title less-space-bottom width-small pretty-green">Equal Opportunities</h2>

        <br />

        <p class="background-purple"><strong>The pre-school believes that its activities should be open to all children and families, and to all adults committed to their welfare</strong>. We aim to ensure that all who wish to work in, or volunteer to help with, our pre-school have an equal chance to do so.</p>

        <p>The pre-school is open to every family in the community and any family joining will be made aware of our policy on equal opportunities.</p>

        <p><strong>Employment</strong>: The pre-school will appoint the best person for each job and will treat fairly all applications for jobs and all those appointed.</p>

        <p><strong>Families</strong>: The pre-school recognises that many different types of family successfully love and care for their children.</p>

        <p><strong>Festivals</strong>: Our aim is to show respectful awareness of all major events in the lives of the children and families in the pre-school, and in our society as a whole, and to welcome the diversity of backgrounds from which they come.</p>

          <p>In order to achieve this, without indoctrination in any faith, children will be encouraged to welcome a range of different festivals, together with stories, celebrations and certain food and clothing they involve, as part of the diversity of life.</p>

        <p><strong>Activities</strong>: All children will be respected and their individuality and potential recognised, valued and nurtured. Activities and the use of equipment will offer children opportunities to develop in an environment free from prejudice and discrimination.</p>

        <p>Appropriate opportunities will be given to children to explore, acknowledge and value similarities and differences between themselves and others.</p>

        <p><strong>Resources</strong>: Resources will be chosen to give children a balanced view of the world and an appreciation of the rich diversity of our multi-racial society.</p>

        <p>Materials will be selected to help children to develop their self-respect and to respect other people by avoiding stereotypes and derogatory pictures and messages about any group of people.</p>

        <p><strong>Special needs</strong>: The pre-school recognises the wide range of special needs of children and families in the community, and will consider what part it can play in meeting these needs.</p>

        <p><strong>Discriminatory behaviour and remarks</strong>: These are unacceptable in the pre-school. The response will aim to be sensitive to the feelings of the victim(s) and to help those responsible to understand and overcome their prejudices.</p>

        <p><strong>Food</strong>: Medical, cultural and dietary needs will be met.</p>
