            <li>Visit the Pre-school with your child. Observe the other children and how they order their day. Talk about how, when at Pre-school you can have drinks and snacks and make new friends.</li>
            <li>Discuss the pre-school with your child. Talk about the staff you have met and the other children who were there.</li>
            <li>Arm your child with practical information like how to hang up their coat. Dress your child comfortably in suitable clothes. Getting dirty is a big concern for young children. </li>
            <li>Practice leaving your child with a trusted friend/grandparent. Make sure the child is aware of what is happening. Short separations are a good way for your child to develop the understanding and trust that is needed to ensure they have a good time when you are not there. </li>

            <li>At these sessions your child will have the chance to explore the classroom. The staff are there to deal with any problems your child might have.</li>
            <li>Afterwards discuss the child's day; encourage chat about equipment/friends/activities they liked. Encourage and support by emphasising how our pre-school is their school. If the child is apprehensive discuss what you will do together after pre-school, maybe a treat/visit to the park.</li>
            <li>If your child mentions a child's name, ask our School manager to introduce you to their parents. One recognisable face can mean a lot to a new child; invite the child to meet up with them outside of pre-school.</li>

            <li>If your child repeatedly displays "disruptive" inappropriate behaviour our School Manager and the child's key worker will put in place a strategy to work from within our pre-school. Our School Manager will discuss all of this with the parents and child prior to implementation.</li>

            <li>Many children come to pre-school interested in the new environment and all the new activities. Once the child has accustomed themselves to the pre-school, they can sometimes start to wonder 'what does mummy do when I'm here' and become aware of what they are missing and then maybe not want to attend pre-school. Encourage your child prior to coming; explain what you are going to do while they are at pre-school and what you and the child can do after pre-school.</li>
            <li>Other children immediately don't want to be separated from their careers and will not want to come at all. This is an adjustment time and slowly with the work of parents and teachers, the child will develop a bond with the pre-school and feel safe and secure – and importantly – feel that they belong.</li>
