The Committee is made up of non-remunerated volunteers; parents and local professional people who work together with the Pre-school to ensure the best for our children.</p>

        <h2 class="title less-space-bottom width-small pretty-purple">Fundraising Team</h2>

        <br />

        <p class="background-green-light">The Montessori way of teaching is a unique method that requires very specific and expensive equipment. The Pre-school is a charitable, not-for-profit making organisation and raises funds through events arranged by the Fundraising Team. This enables our pre-school to purchase additional Montessori equipment, which helps to keep the school fees at an affordable rate.</p>

        <p>The Fundraising Team meets every 6-8 weeks, dependent on the events that need to be discussed and arranged. There is always a member of staff at the meetings, so you also get to meet your child's teachers informally. <strong>New parents are always needed as we are constantly brainstorming for new fundraising ideas!</strong></p>

        <div class="centre-600">

          <?php perch_content('Image 3'); ?>

        </div>

        <p><strong>Details of the next meeting arranged for the Fundraising Team will be displayed on our notice board</strong>, as well as being highlighted in our newsletters.</p>

        <p>The Fundraising Team organises:</p>

        <ul class="compact background-orange-light">
          <li><strong>Tubes of Bubbles</strong>: Tubes are given out to the children; the children then fill the tube with coins and return to the Pre-school near to Easter.</li>
          <li><strong>Sponsored wheels</strong>: Held in Victoria Park in May/June</li>
          <li><strong>Teddy bear's picnic</strong>: Held in Victoria Park in June/July</li>
          <li><strong>Winter Fayre/An Annual Raffle</strong>: Held at our Pre-schools Annual General Meeting in December</li>
          <li><strong>Christmas gifts</strong>: Cards made by your child, calendars of your child, letters to Santa, Handprint Bags</li>
        </ul>



        <p>All these activities enable the Fundraising Team to provide extra curriculum events for the children at the end of each term, as well as contributing towards the costs of the Montessori Materials.</p>
