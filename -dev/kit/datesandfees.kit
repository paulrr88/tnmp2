        <p>Fees are payable in advance and may be paid weekly, monthly or termly. All sick days and absent days, including holidays taken in term time, must be paid for and cannot be exchanged for other days.</p>

If you would like to set up a standing order, please ask the classroom manager for the school's bank details. We regret that we cannot accept payment by credit/debit card or by Direct Debit at present.</p>

However, WSCC funds a maximum of 38 weeks of the year, whereas we open for 43 including half-term holidays. Any sessions over and above those funded by WSCC must be paid for in full by you.</p>

        <p>To apply for your Free Entitlement you must complete an application to the West Sussex Early Years Partnership, available from us, and show us your child's birth certificate as proof of age. The grant payments are made directly to the school. <?php perch_content('Link to EYPP document'); ?>.</p>
